# Cardio-Signal-Processing
----------------------
These are two different types of biosignals obtained simultaneously in our internal studies: 
1-PPG is the optical measurement of the pulse from the finger (using the camera).
2-ECG is the recording of the electrical activity of the heart. 

To analyze blood pressure or other metrics later, we need raw data. This data must be filtered to reduce noise and have the baseline of the signals detrended. This process ensures clear signals to build and use our model effectively.
